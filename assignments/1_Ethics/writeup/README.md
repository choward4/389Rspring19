## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (25 pts)

This was done via the [ELMS assignment](). (we'll post an announcement when this is ready!)

### Part 2 (75 pts)

Considering it is my job to inspect the ECU firmware, I should tell my boss and whoever work protocol says I should be communicating with. Ideally, with a breach like this, having less people know about the situation will improve the chances that the information is not leaked to the public. At this stage, I would most certainly not tell the public or a consumer watchodg.

If the company is unwilling to postpone the ECU's release, my first thought would be to reach out to my boss's boss and see if that will make a difference. If that is not feasable or doesn't work, then my next thought would be to try and reach out to a government agency such as the FBI since the company is almost certainly breaking a federal law by endangering the public in such a way. Going to a watchdog or the public could pssibly result in harm since people would be aware of the vulnerability. That would not be a good thing to do.

If I do nothing, then I would not be in legal responsibility for any harm that ensues (or so I currently believe). I am guessing the eventual legal fallout would be pinned on those with authority. In any case, I should carefully record all communication with my boss so that I can prove legally that I should not be held liable. Communicating via email would allow me to have a permanent record of what was said.

However, I would most likely be morally responsible for the harm that results if I could have prevented it. The dilemma between ethics and legality doesn't have a clear cut answer. But, I would personally try to err on the side of legality when possible.
