## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

When first presented with this problem, I looked into the linux Dig command to see if there was anything useful for me to learn. I then decided I could just end the command with a semicolon and enter my own commands.
First, I executed the "nc 1337bank.money 1337" command to nc into the server and begin my attack. I was then prompted for input. Since I knew the input would be added to the end of the DiG command, I entered "; find . -name "*flag*"" as my input. This was to find any file that contained the word flag that existed in the system. It then returned the input and also the output of my command, revealing that thee was a file called flag.txt in the home directory. I then nc'ed into the server again, this time entering "; cd home && cat flag.txt". This allowed me to see the contents of the newly discovered flag file. The output returned the contents of the file which is where I found the flag.
I would suggest that v0idcache sanatize the input that she receives. That can be done through either outright rejecting input that contains dangerous characters like ";" "/" or "*". Otherwise, the input string could simply be modified to remove those dangerous characters from the input.

### Part 2 (60 pts)

The script inject.py leverages a command injection vulnerability within the server of 1337bank.money. This vulnerability exists because you are able to end the command early by inputting ";" and following it up with whatever command you want to execute. This is how the script works, by taking your input and exploiting this vulnerability to give a seamless experience hacking into the server.

When you first start the program, you will be prompted to enter a command. If you enter "shell" then you will be able to enter an interactive shell which will allow you to navigate through the terminal of the server. You can use any command that you could usually use in a linux based command line. The other command is pull <remote-path> <local-path>. The remote path will specify the file you wish to download. The local path will specify what file you wish to copy the remote file to. If you do not already have a file by the name of your local-path, one will be created. You can always call the command "help" to bring up the menu. which will display all of the commands and give a brief summary of what they do. If you wish to exit the entire program, you can simply enter "quit".
